# *PMS1* as a target for splice modulation to prevent somatic CAG repeat expansion in Huntington's disease

## McLean, Z. L. et al.,

This repository contains all of the data and code used to generate the plots and stats for our manuscript. It is an Rstudio project, so the entire repository can be imported into Rstudio and all of the code executed (R v4.2.1). Dependencies were managed by [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) so renv::restore() will get all of the appropriate package versions.

A rendered html file can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zachariahmclean/2023_splice_modulators/blob/main/figs%20and%20stats.html).
